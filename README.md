# BMI-Calculator

HTML is used for the general structure of the bmiCalculator.

Node.js is used to liberate Javascript from the browser and to allow programmers to use JS to interact with the compuster directly.

I am also able to use pre-designed features from Express.js, which is a node framework, to organize and structurize the code.
